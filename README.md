# Recipe Search App

![Placeholder for picture](picture.png)

This is a simple recipe search application that allows users to search for recipes using a RESTful API. The application is built using React and Bootstrap for the front-end, and Node.js and Express for the back-end.

## Functionality

The Recipe Search App has the following functionality:

- **Search for Recipes:** Users can search for recipes by entering a keyword or phrase into the search bar. The application will display a list of recipes that match the search query.

- **View Recipe Details:** Users can click on a recipe from the search results to view its details. The details page includes the recipe name, image, ingredients, and cooking instructions.

- **Add Recipes to Favorites:** Users can add recipes to their favorites list by clicking the "Add to Favorites" button on the recipe details page. This allows users to easily access their favorite recipes at a later time.

- **View Favorite Recipes:** Users can view their favorite recipes by clicking on the "Favorites" link in the navigation bar. This will display a list of all the recipes that the user has added to their favorites list.

## Technologies Used

The Recipe Search App uses the following technologies:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Bootstrap:** A front-end framework for building responsive web applications.

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.

- **Express:** A Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs.

- **RESTful API:** The application uses the Edamam Recipe Search API to retrieve recipe data. The API provides a simple and intuitive way to retrieve recipe data using HTTP requests. The application sends a GET request to the API with the user's search query, and the API responds with a list of recipes that match the query. The application then displays the recipe data to the user using React.
